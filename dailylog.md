Ways to improve program:
1. prompt the user to enter the food they ate and how many servings.
2. make a function that returns food when the input is slightly off. e.g. return "Pizza Rolls" when the input you put in 
is "pizzarolls".
3. display the entire food library with a function
4. make it easy to search that library
5. Produce a little intro when run that also lists some basic commands
6. do stuff that lists high protein and things like that.
